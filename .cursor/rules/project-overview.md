   # Project Overview and Instructions

   The objective of this project is To build a cross-platform app for saving and searching personal notes.

   This is a monorepo.

   - The Flutter frontend is in /client-flutter.
   - The Supabase backend is in /Supabase.
   - Project notes are in /notes-dax.

   # Documentation

   Please write notes, guides, and documentation to the /notes-dax folder (But write plans to the .cursor/plans folder)

   Whenever you write a plan, please also create appropriate guides and documentation in /notes-dax, including mermaid diagrams where appropriate.

   Mermaid diagrams go in the /notes-dax/assets/diagrams folder. Mermaid diagram png images are generated from these using /notes-dax/mermaid.sh and go in the /notes-dax/assets/images folder. These images are then referenced in the documentation markdown files.

   # Style

   For the Frontend UI design, my style preference is minimalist and clean.
