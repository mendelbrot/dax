   # Project Overview and Instructions

   The objective of this project is To build a cross-platform app for saving and searching personal notes.

   This is a monorepo.

   - The Flutter frontend is in /client-flutter.
   - The Supabase backend is in /Supabase.
   - Project notes are in /notes-dax.

   Please write notes, guides, and documentation to the /notes-dax folder (But write plans to the .cursor/plans folder)

   For the Frontend UI design, my style preference is minimalist and clean.
